// Dummy data for now. Am I required to add relationships? e.g: one class has many students 

var instructorList = [
    {instructorName: 'Joe', age: 30}
];

var classList = [
    {className: 'Introduction to OOP'}
];

var studentList = [
    {studentName: 'Khaliq', age:19}
];

module.exports = {instructorList, classList, studentList};
